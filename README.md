2018 update to USHMM Statistical Risk Assessment for mass atrocity forecasts

Replication files for the 2018 edition of USHMM's statistical risk assessment. 


The first and biggest point to note is that you should use the data stored in the repo, "prepared_data_final_15Oct2018.RData". This is preferable to regenerating the data yourself, since doing so requires a host of anciliary files, pulling data from online sources, etc.  We nevertheless include an R file ("not_run_makedata_15Oct2018") that manages the data construction process, for reference and replicability.
